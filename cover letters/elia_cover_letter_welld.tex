Dear WellD Team,

\vspace{1em}

I am excited to apply for the \textbf{Senior Full Stack Engineer} position at WellD. With over a decade of experience in software development—including full-stack web, mobile, and backend systems—I’m passionate about building high-quality, maintainable software and working in collaborative, engineering-driven environments like yours.

At \textit{Compasso UOL}, I led the development of full-stack and mobile applications using \textbf{React}, \textbf{Node.js}, and \textbf{React Native}, architecting scalable solutions for enterprise clients and working closely with designers and stakeholders. I’m comfortable working across the stack and enjoy contributing to both frontend experiences and backend APIs, including CI/CD workflows and containerized deployments with Docker.

Currently, I’m pursuing a \textbf{PhD in Informatics at Università della Svizzera italiana (USI)}, where I conduct research in distributed systems using \textbf{Java}, \textbf{Go}, and \textbf{Python} in Linux environments. This academic experience complements my industry background, reinforcing my focus on code quality, performance, and fault-tolerant design. I also administer a Linux cluster and contribute to core system components, deepening my systems engineering skills.

What draws me to WellD is your clear commitment to software craftsmanship: from Agile development and CI/CD to pair programming and continuous learning. I’m especially aligned with your use of technologies like Java, Kotlin, React, and Docker—and your culture of sharing through blogging, meetups, and open source.

Thank you for considering my application. I would love to contribute my experience and energy to WellD’s mission and collaborate with your talented team in Agno.

Best regards, \\
