\opening{Dear USI Startup Centre Team,}

I am excited to apply to the USI Startup Centre as the founder of \textbf{KAIROS}. This project builds on my research and experience in \textbf{distributed systems}, \textbf{fault-tolerant architectures}, and \textbf{real-time data processing}, and I am passionate about turning these insights into a platform that enables enterprises to deploy \textbf{AI agents} capable of {reasoning} over {evolving knowledge} in real time.

The idea for {KAIROS} stems from a clear industry need: enterprises today struggle to integrate {dynamic, domain-specific knowledge} into AI systems efficiently. Through my \textbf{PhD research} and recent experiments with {LLM models} and {MCP servers}, I have explored {incremental reasoning workflows} and developed a strong understanding of how LLMs can interact with {structured knowledge}. What excites me most about this project is the opportunity to {bridge cutting-edge distributed systems research} with {real-world enterprise applications}, delivering tangible \textbf{efficiency gains} and enabling \textbf{smarter decision-making}.

Being incubated at the USI Startup Centre is particularly appealing because of its unique combination of {academic rigor} and \textbf{entrepreneurial support}. The Centre’s {mentorship}, \textbf{funding support}, and \textbf{industry network} can help {KAIROS} grow from a research prototype to a \textbf{fully functional, impactful platform}. I am especially eager to receive guidance on {business development}, {go-to-market strategy}, {IP management}, and preparing for pilot deployment with early adopters like \textbf{\underline{Swisscom}}.

Joining the USI Startup Centre will let me focus full-time on {KAIROS}, speed up development, and use the Centre’s ecosystem to turn research into a \textbf{high-impact business}. With their support, {KAIROS} can become a leading platform for \textbf{real-time AI reasoning} over {dynamic knowledge graphs}, delivering value to \textbf{Swiss enterprises} and beyond.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to contribute to and benefit from the vibrant {startup ecosystem} at USI.

\closing{Sincerely,\\[1em] Eliã Rafael de Lima Batista}
